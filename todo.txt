controls:
x 1) left and right buttons to move shape left and right
2) press arrowdown button to hasten descent. lift arrowdown button to revert descent to default speed
3) space bar to place shape immediately

shape descent:
1) spawn new shape right after previous shape is placed
2) based on number of lines cleared, increase speed of descent (descentIntervalDuration)

score:
1) for casual play, increase number of lines cleared
2) for competitive play, increase score for number of lines cleared and give bonus points for multiple lines cleared at once

IDK HOW TO LABEL THESE
1) create an array with all the blocks in the block stack. on each descent of the current shape, check if the shape collides with the 
stack. If it collides, place the shape.




customisation options:
1) randomise color of tetris shapes. might look jarring because there isn't a smooth and gradual transition between hues.
2) if the stack of blocks rises higher than the mid-point of the grid, change the color of all blocks to match the background 
(meant to torture players into keeping their stack below the midpoint.)
